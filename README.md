### Installation
**Note:** Local environment tested on Ubuntu and macOS. Feel free to create an Issue for other OS.   
1. **Clone repository**
    ````
    mkdir {YOUR_NEW_FOLDER}
    cd {YOUR_NEW_FOLDER}
    git clone git@github.com:dmsemenov/laravel-docker-environment.git .
    ````
2. **Configure main `.env` file**
    ````
    cp .env.example .env
    ````
   Set `PROJECT_NAME` variable.  
   Set `PROJECT_FOLDER` variable for example 'backend' or whatever you want. By default it is `main`.


3. **Configure main `docker-compose.yml` file**
   ````
   # Local development
   cp docker-compose.yml.local docker-compose.yml
   ````
   Set variables for mysql container. Docker will create database and user at first UP.
   ````
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:  
   MYSQL_DATABASE: ${PROJECT_NAME}  
   MYSQL_USER: ${PROJECT_NAME}  
   MYSQL_PASSWORD:
   ````

3. **Install Application**  
   Install or copy your existing application to `PROJECT_FOLDER`.  
   ````
   # Run containers
   docker-compose up -d --build
   # Install new
   docker-compose exec php-fpm composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .
   ````

4. **Configure Application `.env`**

   Set variables from *step 3* 
   ````
   DB_HOST=mysql  
   DB_DATABASE=  
   DB_USERNAME=  
   DB_PASSWORD=  
   ````
5. **Run Application**
   ````
   # Run containers
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Base UI. If needed!
   docker-compose exec -uwww-data php-fpm composer require laravel/ui --dev
   docker-compose exec -uwww-data php-fpm php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
   
   # Build frontend
   docker-compose run --rm --no-deps -unode node bash -ci 'npm i&&npm run dev'
   
   # Migrate
   docker-compose exec -uwww-data php-fpm php artisan migrate
   
   docker-compose exec -uwww-data php-fpm composer install
   ````
6. **Launch http://localhost:8989/register**   
   
### Production and LetsEncrypt 
Repository do not show full flow how to deploy docker application with build and docker registry, 
it can be used with simple git pull from your repository.  
For production without https you can use `develop` branch and production files.
   ````
   # Production
   cp docker-compose.yml.prod docker-compose.yml #this compose file use nginx production config 
   ````
If you are going to use LetsEncrypt at production look at branch 'letsencrypt' this repository.
Branch contains ready to use configuration for letsEncrypt in production based on great article [Nginx and Letâ€™s Encrypt with Docker in Less Than 5 Minutes](https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71).  

To use letsEncrypt at production just follow steps below:
1. Initial settings   
   Open ``./init-letsencrypt.sh`` add your domains instead `{YOUR_DOMAIN}` www.`{YOUR_DOMAIN}` and set `{YOUR_EMAIL}`.   
   Run ``./init-letsencrypt.sh``. It will create initial settings.  
   Note: don't forget to add A DNS record for domain with www. 
2. Nginx settings  
   At `.provision/nginx/conf.d/vhost.prod.conf` set `{YOUR_DOMAIN}` variable.
Certificates stored at .provision folder and will be renew as described in article.
